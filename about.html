  <h2>#Mission</h2>
  <h6>Printing “Hello, world!” in a console is the first thing that people do when they learn a new programming language. Just like the meaning behind the phrase, we want to provide support for students -- no matter their proficiency in technological concepts -- to learn to stand their ground in the vast field of tech. <br><br>We aim to foster an environment where individuals passionate about technology can help improve digital literacy and accessibility. We focus on preparing students for the oncoming era and providing opportunities to utilize their talents.</h6>
